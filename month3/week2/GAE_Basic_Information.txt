Google App Engine
It is started at 2008.
Simplest way to deploy and scale your application in GCP(Google Cloud Platform).
Provides end to end application management

Supports Go, Java,.NET, Node.js,PHP, Python,Ruby using pre-configured runtimes.
Use custom run-time and write code in any language.
Connect to variety of Google Cloud storage products(Cloud  SQL)

It is free of cost. Pay for resources.

Features:
Automatic load balancing & Auto Scaling
Managed platform updates & Application health monitoring
Application versioning
Traffic Splitting


Compute Engine vs App Engine

Compute Engine
-It is IAAS
-It is more Flexible
-It has more Responsibilities:
   -Choosing image, Installing S/w, Choosing Hardware, Fine Grained Access/Permissions, -Availability.

App Engine
-It is PAAS.
-It is Serverless
-Lesser Responsibility
-Lower Flexibility


App Engine Environments

-Runs in Standard and Flexible

Standard: Runs in language specific sandboxes
  We have 2 versions
  v1: which run in Java, Python, PHP, Go(OLD Versions)
       -Only for python and php runtimes:
            -restricted network access
            -only white listed extensions and libraries are allowed
       -No restrictions for java and go runtimes
  v2: java, python, php, node.js,ruby,go(NEWER versions_
        -Full n/w access and no restrictions on language extensions

Flexible: Application instances run with Docker Containers
  -support any runtime, built - in support also.
  -make use of compute engine virtual machines
  -provide access to bg processes and local disks


App Engine: Application Component Hierarchy
Application: One App per Project

Service: Multiple Microservices or App components
 - You can have multiple services in a single application
 -Each service can have different settings

Versions: Each version assoicated with code and configuration
  -Each version can run in one or more instances
  -Multiple versions can co-exist
  -Options to rollback and split traffic

App Engine-Scaling Instances

Automatic-If we have more workload.
Basic-Not supported by Flexible.(Based on request instances are created)
Manual-Configure specific number of requests.

Config of GAE

Commands:
gcloud config set project "project name which is located in GAE"

gcloud app deploy

gcloud app services list (displays the number of services)

gcloud app instaces list (displays all the instances)

gcloud app versions list (displays the versions)

gcloud app --versions=v2 (setting up the version for the project)

gcloud app browse (used to give back the url for the project

gcloud app --version "version name" gives back the url for the project

gcloud app deploy --version=v3 --no-promote (this is command is gonna run the newer version of the appliation but without switching the traffic)

watch curl "url" (get request to the url specified)

gcloud app services set-traffic--splits=v3=.5,v2=.5(This command would split the traffic)

gcloud app services set-traffic--splits=v3=.5,v2=.5 --split-by=random(splits traffic randomly)
