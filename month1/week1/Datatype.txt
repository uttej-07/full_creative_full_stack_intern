                            Data types in Java
What is Datatype?
-Data types are different sized and values that can be stored in a variable.
-The programmer has all the access of which data they want to use.

-When it comes to Java, Java is a statically typed language. Means, if we declare a variable in one data type it can't hold another data type.
Even C,C++ comes into this caategory.

-Python,Ruby comes under Dynamically typed language.

-In Java we need to predefine the datatype which is not necessary in Python.

Data types in Java:
There are 2 types:
1)Primitive Datatype
2)Non-Primitive Datatype

1)Primitive Datatype:
 -They are most common used datatypes in Java.
 -They are used for data manipulation and they don't have any special capabilities in them.
-There are 8 primitive types in Java.

                                                     float           double


1)Boolean
-Boolean return only 1-bit of information either True or False.
-Size of the boolean datatype if virtually machine - independent.
-Boolean datatype values can't converted.
-Default value of Boolean is False.

Syntax:

boolean var = true;
boolean var = false;

2)Byte
-It is of 8-bit(1 byte) signed integer. Byte datatype is used to save memory in large arrays.
-Values in Byte are from -128 to 127. Default value of byte is 0.

Syntax:
byte var = 126;
byte var = 127;
byte var = 128; //output : -128 because it extends the size.

3)short
-It is of 16-bit(2 bytes) signed integer. Similarly to byte even short can save memory when we are working on large arrays. But, situation matters on which data type to use.
-Values are from -32,768 to 32,767 and the default is 0.

Syntax:

short var;
short var = 10;
short var =  32,767;

4)int
-It is of 32-bit(4 bytes) signed integer.We frequently use integers in programming language.
-Values are from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 and the default value is 0.
-In java se 8 and later, unsigned integer came into use.

Syntax:

int a;
int a= 10;

5)Long
-It is of 64 bits(8 bytes) signed integer. Long is used very rarely. We use when the value size is more than int.
-In java se 8 and later, unsigned integer came into use.
-Values are from -9, 223, 372, 036, 854, 775, 808 to 9, 223, 372, 036, 854, 775, 807 and the default value is 0.

Syntax:

long v;
long v = 123,456,789,012;

6)Float
-Float type is mainly used for storing values which are in decimal format.
-It is of 32-bit(4 bytes) floating-point.
-To save memory for large arrays we can use floating type float and the default value is 0.0
-It can store upto 7 decimal digits.

Syntax:

float v1 = 9.87; // we come across with an error that it is an incompatible type.

float v1=9.87f;// Output is 9.87

7)Double
-It is of 64-bit(8 bytes) floating point. When we are working on huge programs then we need to use Double.
-It can store upto 16 decimal digits and the default value is 0.0.
-It is created for scientific calculations.

Syntax:

double var;
double var = 87.9845;

8)char
-It is used to store character.
-It is of 16-bit(2 bytes) Unicode character.
-Values are from  ‘\u0000’ (0) to ‘\uffff’ (65535) and the default value is '\u0000'.
-Java used Unicode instead of ASCII.So, java uses 2 bytes of data to store all the character data in it.

Syntax:

char c;
char c = 'a';

Example:
  Example1:

    class Dt1 {
 
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        char a = 'U';

        int i = 89;
 
        // use byte and short
        // if memory is a constraint
        byte b = 4;
 
        // this will give error as number is
        // larger than byte range
        // byte b1 = 7888888955;
 
        short s = 56;
 
        // this will give error as number is
        // larger than short range
        // short s1 =989898989;
 
        double d = 4.355453532;

        float f = 4.7333434f;
      
          long l = 121212121;
            
          System.out.println("char: " + a);
        System.out.println("integer: " + i);
        System.out.println("byte: " + b);
        System.out.println("short: " + s);
        System.out.println("float: " + f);
        System.out.println("double: " + d);
          System.out.println("long: " + l);
    }
}
