                       Deployment Descriptor
-Deployment Descriptor file tells how to deploy a WebApplication.
-It tells more about the file than its security files and file description.
-For web applications written in java programming, deployment descriptor is written using the XML.
-Deployment descriptor is named as web.xml and it is under WEB-INF.
-The content of the file describes the security files, content files, configuration requirements and container options.
-While declaring the deployment descriptor files, we should also declare versions and other files which lets declare even security related tags.
Some of the tag:
<servlet-name>
<servlet-class>
<servlet-mapping>

Servlet-tags
-In web.xml we need to set Servlet tags by which we can have communication with web application.
-Servlet mapping controls how you access a servlet.
<servlet>
<servlet-name>
<servlet-class>

-The above 3 tags are used to define a servlet and name,class of the servlet.
-Class defines the path of the servlet

<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>
<url-pattern>

-servlet mapping tag will be used for access and control of servlet
-<url-pattern>- it defines the type of files whether it is a html,html,jsp,image files, etc.

-We can set up default servlet. Default servlet can also be setup manually automatically.
-While setting up default servlet we need to be careful while defining it.
-WebLogic server uses an internal servlet called the FileServlet as the default servlet.

Error page:
-It defines when we come any error.
-Internally if we won't throw any expection for the code. At, that time an error may occur in WebApplication.
-When an error occurs—while WebLogic Server is responding to an HTTP request, or as a result of a Java exception—WebLogic Server returns an HTML page that displays either the HTTP error code or a page containing the Java error message. You can define your own HTML page to be displayed in place of these default error pages or in response to a Java exception.
tags
<error-code>- A valid HTTP error code.
<exception-type>- We can know what type of exception is occured.
<location>-Where the exact exception has occured.
<location> tag is mandatory

-We can define error page in 2 ways:
1)By using JSP
2)By using JSP and servlet

Welcome-page
-For every web application we need a welcome page which tells about the application and services in it.

-In WEB-INF file we can define welcome page using few tags

-<welcome-file-list> element contains an ordered list of welcome-file elements.

-<welcome-file-list> is used to define the files that will be called by the server by default.

welcome-file-list in web.xml
index.html
index.htm
index.jsp
The server returns a 404 error if none of these files are found.

-When webserver checks for the welcome file it will check <welcome-file-list>, when that tag is found, then it will see the attributes inside it and starts the working, if the <welcome-file-list> isn't found then it will look at the default welcome files which can be a html, html, jsp files.

Session-config:
-The number of minutes after which sessions in the Web application expire.
we need to define the tags <session-config> and inside it we can use<session-timeout> and define the number of minutes not seconds.

-<session-timeout>-number of minutes after which sessions in the Web application expire.

-It contains a Default value: -2
-Maximum value: Integer.MAX_VALUE/60
-In <session-timeout> -2 uses the value set by TimeoutSecs in <session-descriptor>.
-In<session-timeout> -1- Session doesn't timeout. but it is ignored.

-<session-descriptor>- it defines the tags <param-name> and <param-value>. and it is used to connect html and servlets(java).
