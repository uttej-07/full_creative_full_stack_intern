Servlet

-Servlet which helps to extend the capability of a server by letting it improve and increase request.
-Servlet is used for implementing Web-Application
-Servlet API acts as a Interface and contain classes.
-Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.
-Servlet container which is a Servlet Engine, which helps the servlet to handle the request from the clients.

-Before Servlets we have the same functionality i.e, CGI(Common Gateway Interface). But, there are few limitations which are prevented in Servlets. Even PHP is one of ther server side handler.

-Servlets are Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. They are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce the response, then send a response back to the web-server


Client<--->Web-Server<-->Servlet<-->Database

-Servlet work on the server-side.

-While client can send the request to web server via HTTP Protocol.
-If we are using Servlet then it is dynamic web application.
-If we are only using HTTP protocol then it is static web application.

-Servlets are java programs which run on JVM on the server-side.
-A dynamic web application can change the things in it. But, a static application will not change it.

-Whenever there is a change at database then the web application will also change which is dynamic.
-But, when comes to static there will be a server but there will no database.
-So, servlet is a dynamic web application.

Role of servlet in dynamic web application development?
-Extends the servers that host the applications accessed by means of request-response of programming model.
-they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.

-Servlet starts life when the container finds the servlet class file.

Servlets are build from 2 packages:
1)javax.servlet
2)javax.servlet.http

Advantages of Servlet:
1)It uses threads.
2)It doesn't use the CGI functionality process. It overheads it and create a single to handle.
3)As it is server side component, servlet inherits the security provided by the web server.
4)Servlets use web servers and many servers are free.
5)It consumes less memory.

How java servlet make web application dynamic?
-When client sends a request, the webserver accepts the request and communicates with the servlet
-Where servlet takes the request from the web-server and it goes the brings the output for the request and gives that response to web-server where that response will be given back to client.
-Here, Servlet is taking the input working on the output and giving back the response which is dynamic in nature.
