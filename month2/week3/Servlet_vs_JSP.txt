-Servlets should be used when there is more data processing. When there is less data processsing JSP needs to be used.

-There are no custom tags writing facility in Servlets. Whereas in JSP we can build custom tags that can directly call Java Beans.

-In servlets business and presentation logic is implemented in a single file. Whereas in JSP business logic is split from presentation logic using Java Beans.
