                                                  JSP Directive Tags

-JSP directives are the messages to JSP container.
-JSP directive tags help in translating a JSP page into Servlet page.
-They provide entire information about JSP page.
-They provide instructions to JSP Engine/container of how to convert the JSP page to Servlet Page.

<%@ %>- This is the syntax used for writing directives.

-There are 3 types of  directives:
1)Page Directive
2)Include Directive
3)TagLib Directive

1)PageDirective
-It consist of information of how a servlet page needs to be. All those tags and attributes are declared in JSP Page.

-Attributes which are presented in this JSP page will be taken in consideration and JSP Engine using these attributes it will convert into Servlet page.

There are 13 attributes which contain their own functionality:

1)Language
2)Extends
3)Import
4)contentType
5)info
6)session
7)isThreadSafe
8)autoflush
9)buffer
10)IsErrorPage
11)pageEncoding
12)errorPage
13)isELIgnored


-All the page attributes need to declared inside <%@ page %>
1)Language

-It defines what type of language we are using for defing the JSP.

<%@ page language = " java "%>

2)Extends

-It will be inheriting the class as how JAVA does.

<%@ page extends = "HttpServlet"%>

3)Import

-It will be importing other classes, interfaces as how java does in it.

<%@ page import = "java.util.Scanner"%>

4)contentType

-It is used to define the header of a web-page to display the type of content and standard character set of an HTML page.

<%@ page contentType = "text/html; charset =ISO-8859-1" % >

other contentTypes are

Image/jpeg: JPEG image file
image/tiff: TIFF image file
Text/plain: TXT file
Video/mpeg: MPA,MP2, MPE
Audio/mpeg: MP3 files
Audio/x-wav: wav files

5)info

-It is used to set the servlet description.
-Which is accessed by getServletInfo() method.

In JSP:
<%@ page info = "Uttej JSP" %>

In Servlet:
public String getServletInfo(){
 return "Uttej JSP"
}

6)Session

-Sessions are used to track the client whether there are new or not.
-In Jsp sessions can be declared default.
-The default value of session is true

<%@ page session = "true/false" %>

7)isThreadSafe

-It implements the thread safety.
-Default value of it is True.
-If it is true then it implements single Thread Model Interface and multiple threads can be accessed and synchronization also works.
-If it is false then it implements single Thread Model but only one thread is allowed to access until the present thread request is responded.

<%@ page isThreadSafe = "true/false" %>

8)AutoFlush

-It will be flushing out the buffered data or the output data.
-Auto flush is depended on the type of value we specify
-If is true , it will get flushed automatically
-If is false, manually we need to flush out the data and if becomes full then we get an exception.

<%@ page autoFlush =  "true/false" %>

9)Buffer

-It is used to handle the buffer size or the size of the output generated by the JSP page.
-The default size of buffer is 8KB.

<%@ page buffer = "value" %>

10)isErrorPage

-It is used to declare the current page is the error page. The exception object can only be used in the error page.
-If there is an error in the JSP then it needs to redirect to the error page.
-The default value is false.
-Any JSP page which declared with "isErrorPage" attribute is then capable to receive exceptions from other JSP pages which have error pages.

<%@ page isErrorPage = "true/false" %>

11)Errorpage

-If current page contains any error then it needs to redirect to the error page to handle exceptions.

<%@ page errorPage = errorhandler.jsp" %>

12)pageEncoding

-We will be encoding the page. We use this because whenever it is translating it needs to be in understandable manner. So, we use pageEncoding.
-Character encoding of a JSP page.
-Character encoding is used to tell the computer how to interpret digital data into letters, numbers and symbols.

<%@ page pageEncdoing  =  "ISO-8859-1" %>

other encoding types are 
 ISO-8859-2
 ISO-8859-3
 US-ASCIII

13)isElIgnored

-Expression Language makes it possible to easily access application data stored in JavaBeans components.
-By default value is false, it we set it true then Expression Language is Ignored.

<%@ page isELIgnored = "true/false" %>

Include Directive Tag

-This tag is used to include one file in another file.
Example: We are having a file named A and another file named B. So by using include directive tag we can include B file in A file or vice versa.
-It is helpful in Code reusability.
-The size of the file grows at run-time.

<%@ include file = "resourceName" %>

-It can be any type of file like text,html,jsp. It cannot include dynamic content like servlet. Only static content is allowed.

TagLib Directive Tag

-It is used to define the tag library that defines many tags. We use TLD(Tag Library Descriptor).
-It is mainly used in Custom tags.
-To define JSTL(JSP Standard Library Tag).
-We need to use "taglib" as prefix, which we can use in JSP.

<%@ taglib uri = "uri" prefix = "value" %>

Here uri attribute is a unique identifier in tag library descriptor and prefix attribute is a tag library.

-The Taglib Directive declares that your JSP page uses a set of custom tags, identifies the location of the library, and provides means for identifying the custom tags in your JSP page.
