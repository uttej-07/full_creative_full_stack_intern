1)Declaration Tag

-It is used to declare fields and methods.
-These tags are declared outside the service method which means it can't be called everytime and the memory will be allocated everytime.
-We can declare a static member, an instance variable and methods inside the declaration tag.

Syntax: <%!  Dec var %>

2)Scriptlet Tag

-It is used to write the java code and used to execute java source code in JSP.

-It is used to write the expressions.
-It allows create expressions like arthimetic and logical.
-It produces scriptless JSP page.

<%=  expression %>

-It prints the output of the code. It is written the output stream of the response.

4)Comment tag

-It is used for writing down the comments in the JSP program to know what we are writing

Syntax:
